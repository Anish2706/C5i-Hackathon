# C5i-Hackathon
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
•	Git – for cloning the repository.
•	Python (latest version recommended) – for running the scripts.
•	Jupyter Notebook – for executing the .ipynb file.
•	Pip – for managing Python packages.
•	Any additional dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

REQUIREMENTS 
•	numpy==1.24.3 – Essential for numerical computing and handling arrays.
•	pandas==1.5.3 – Provides data structures and analysis tools, especially useful for handling datasets.
•	scikit-learn==1.2.2 – A machine learning library for data preprocessing, classification, regression, and clustering.
•	imblearn==0.11.0 – Used for handling imbalanced datasets, particularly for oversampling and undersampling techniques.
•	nltk==3.8.1 – A natural language processing toolkit useful for text-based data analysis.
•	matplotlib==3.7.1 – A plotting library for visualizing data trends and relationships.
•	seaborn==0.12.2 – A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.
•	xgboost==1.7.6 – An optimized gradient boosting library for structured data problems.
•	lightgbm==4.1.0 – A gradient boosting framework that is highly efficient for large datasets.
•	tensorflow==2.12.0 – Used for deep learning applications, including neural networks (optional, if deep learning is required).
•	torch==2.0.1 – PyTorch, another deep learning framework for flexible model building (optional, if deep learning is required).
